    "At a high level, computers do four things:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   run programs\n",
    "-   store data\n",
    "-   communicate with each other, and\n",
    "-   interact with us\n",
    "\n",
    "They can do the last of these in many different ways,\n",
    "including through a keyboard and mouse, or touch screen interfaces, or speech recognition using systems.\n",
    "While such hardware interfaces are becoming more commonplace, most interaction is still\n",
    "done using screens, mice, touchpads and keyboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are all familiar with **graphical user interfaces** (GUI): windows, icons and pointers.\n",
    "They are easy to learn and fantastic for simple tasks where a vocabulary consisting of\n",
    "\"click\" translates easily into \"do the thing I want\". But this magic relies on \n",
    "wanting a simple set of things, and having programs that can do exactly those things.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to do complex, purpose-specific things it helps to have a richer means\n",
    "of expressing your instructions to the computer. It doesn't need to be complicated or\n",
    "difficult, just a vocabulary of commands and a simple grammar for using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the shell provides - a simple language and a **command-line interface** \n",
    "to use it through. \n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of a command-line interface is a **read-evaluate-print loop** (REPL) called\n",
    "so because when you type a command and press <kbd>Return</kbd>.\n",
    "The shell\n",
    "reads it,\n",
    "executes (or \"evaluates\" it),\n",
    "prints the output,\n",
    "prints the prompt and waits for you to enter another command."

    "### The Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "A shell is a program like any other.\n",
    "What's special about it is that its job is to run other programs\n",
    "rather than to do calculations itself.\n",
    "The most popular Unix shell is Bash,\n",
    "the Bourne Again SHell\n",
    "(so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).\n",
    "Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix\n",

    "The first line shows only a **prompt**,\n",

    "when typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,\n",
    "*do not type the prompt*, only the commands that follow it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The part that you type,\n",
    "`ls -F /` in the second line of the example,\n",
    "typically has the following structure: a **command**,\n",
    "some **flags** (also called **options** or **switches**) and an **argument**.\n",
    "Flags start with a single dash (`-`) or two dashes (`--`), and change the behaviour of a command.\n",
    "Arguments tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).\n",
    "Sometimes flags and arguments are referred to as parameters.\n",
    "A command can be called with more than one flag and more than one argument: but a\n",
    "command doesn't always require an argument or a flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second line of the example above, our **command** is `ls`, with a **flag** `-F` and an\n",

    "between `ls` and `-F` the shell will look for a command called `ls-F`, which \n",
    "doesn't exist. Also, capitalization matters: `LS` is different to `ls`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we see the output that our command produced. In this case it is a listing \n",

    "you are.\n",
    "\n",

    "    The shell uses the spaces to split the line into the command, flags, and arguments\n",

    "    a. Find a program called `ls`  \n",
    "    b. Execute it, passing it the flags and arguments (`-F` and `/`) to \n",
    "       interpret as the program sees fit \n",
    "3. Print the output produced by the program\n",
